# Let me tell you a story...

There's this guy, bored, alone, and he finds a way to make a balance beam scale.
He uses it measure things, and he finds that there's a certain angle that the beam 
scale goes to for a certain ratio of things he measures.  It doesn't matter what he measures: rocks,
apples, leaves, it doesn't matter as long as they are all roughly the same weight, the tilt of the
scale is always the same. 


# And then we experimented

This ended up being a more complex sitation than initially observed.  There are rules in Newtonian physics for multiplications of forces or transformations of forces across levers on pivots with various arm lengths, but, not exactly what a balance beam is.  There is a mass of the beam, and a mass of the holders that hold the samples to compare.  In one sense this is also just either a critical overbalance, such that when one side is heavier than the other, then the balance scale will definitely tip all the way in a direction; however this isn't entirely the situtation either.
