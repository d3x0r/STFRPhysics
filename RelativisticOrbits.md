In regards to the [experiment](LightSpeedExperiment.md), it was proposed that GPS is a similar behavior, with multiple sources with stable clocks that a single source receives information from, and then can synchronize its position based on the stable offsets from the satellites.

Since gravity also travels at the speed of light, there is a side where the earth has already been that has a stronger field, signals from this side would be slower to the earth, but since the field is stronger, the satellite is closer, and also since it's closer, its also slightly faster.  Similarly on the leading edge of the Earth, the gravity field has not extended as far, and is weaker, the speed of the signal from that side should be shorter than one would expect, but the satellite is orbiting further, and slower, which makes the overall time the same amount of time.

## Laser Ranging Satellites 
There are similarly satellites that measure the earth's surface elevation; and if they were in egg shaped orbits, one would think that they would then measure the earth as offset within their scope, and that the measured elevations would change over time.  This is where the speed difference matters, since the satellite is faster, it covers a greater distance laterally, so any distance difference in elevation would be made up for in lateral motion, and result in the expected time of signal reception at the speed of light.

## Geostationary Satellites
Similarly even geostationary satellites always appear to be in the same location, and a difference in elevation, further away from the earth, the signal from earth to such a satellite would be faster to the satellite, and a return echo would be slower, overall being 2 trips of the speed of light in time.  

The though was that also a closer orbit would make the satellite orbit faster, because of the angular difference, but to match the earths rotation, it would actually have to move slower.

A quick search reveals:

"The exact position of geostationary satellites relative to the Earth's surface **varies slightly over each 24-hour period** because of gravitational interactions among the satellite, Earth, sun, moon and nonterrestrial planets."

(from the link above)
"**Eccentricity**

The eccentricity of the orbit will affect firstly the orbital height and then as a consequence its velocity at apogee and perigee and thus its longitude and also the shape of the figure-of-8. An example eccentricity is 0.0003, which would lead to a ~12km excursion in height from the Geostationary radius."

The deviation of 12km is 39370.1feet, which is approximately 39 microseconds... or 40027.7 light nanoseconds more precisely (40 microseconds).

Satellite height is around 42,164km (+300km is graveyard) or 140.6439650993light milliseconds.  At 140ms, the deviation expected from our velocity in the universe is +140us, and the deviation from orbiting the sun included is +/-14us, and the earths rotation is then only +/-140ns (basically inconsequential).  This would all seem to be within acceptable margin of error.  (41970.94412m difference in distance, but really only 39871.5m worse case)  ( From Quora : You are not allowed to let it drift more than a milliradian, or more than 30 km, so you must supply thrusters to correct the drift periodically. (east-west))

Geostationary orbits have a speed of 3.07 kilometers per second ( 10 light micro-seconds).

But these orbits are not in the same plane as our motion through the universe which is inclined at 9 degrees, so the satellites will only reach a maximum of 0.951 of maximum/minimum deviation.

"There are two stable equilibrium points (at 75.3°E and 108°W) and two corresponding unstable points (at 165.3°E and 14.7°W)."

The earth has an eccentricity to it that causes instability also.

I suppose the overall delta speed doesn't really affect the angular position very much either, if it lagged or advanced slightly over time.


## Moon Orbit

"The plane of the Moon's orbit is inclined at a mean angle of **5.145°** to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. The intersection of these planes defines two points or nodes on the celestial sphere."  (https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/moonorbit.html)
