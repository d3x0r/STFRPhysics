	Sliders control how many things are on each side of the balance.  Each object has a certain mass, with a slider to control that.  The final slider is the mass of the beam itself.

	<p>When the beam of the balance is heavy, especially compared to the ratio of objects, the balance will never get to maximum tilt.

	<p>Some Math: <pre><code>
   A = object count
   B = other object count
   C = (A+B)/2, which is half of total objects.  This provides a reference for where balance or 0 is.
   a = A/C, ratio of objects on the A side vs the balance of the objects.
   b = B/C, ratio of objects on the B side vs the balance of the objects.

   a+b=2  or  A/C+B/C=2  represent the total weight to be divided; 
                         this is more of a given, along the lines of 1(A)+1(B)=2((A+B)/2)
   			

   The ratio of the weights are; in the below expressions, the C term is mostly meaningless 
   other than a+b=2 part for the normalized versions, since A/C / B/C = A/B  similarly with the inverse.

   (A-B)/A or (A-B)/B  depending on whether A or B is heavier. 	
   1-B/A  or A/B-1  are equivalent to the above expressions.

   the result of the above expressions is the fraction of 0 to 90 degrees that is the tilt of the scale.

   --- When also considering the mass of the beam... ---

   M = beam mass
   m = M/(A+B) which is beam mass per object.

   1-(B+m)/(A+m) and (A+m)/(B+m)-1  are the expressions including beam weight per object.
