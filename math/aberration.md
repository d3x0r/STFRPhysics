I was reflecting on behavior of light due to Light Aberration; Light aberration must also apply on the transmission side that the light is advanced in angle, such that a laser pointing across a space craft will emit its beam advanced by some angle based on its velocity, otherwise, the light would drift down the wall, and appear in a different location; similarly with interferometers - light emitted perpendicular to a velocity must be advanced in angle, the receiver will advance the received angle such that it appears to be coming directly perpendicular, and if it's a reflector, will again emit an advanced beam such that it will meet a splitter at exactly the location it left from.  I see, however, that light aberration is only referenced as a received effect; so if you can't/don't accept it also applies on transmission, the rest will be ludicrous.
Observed galaxies - the side of the galaxy that is moving away from us will be red shifted, but also its light aberrating effect will make it appear more red shifted than it should be, since we'd see further around the emitter than expected; while on the blue side, it will appear less blue shifted than it should; and the faster the stars are, the less blue it appears; on this side, I'd expect this shift to make the velocity curve be flatter than it should be (matching more of the inner velocities); but on the red side, it should be more red shifted.  I don't see any papers/information that has independent calculations from the red side and blue side independently; but also since everything is slightly more red shifted, than it's assumed the galaxy is moving away from us too (which just being distant is already red shifted so that's not surprising).  
I do wonder if the actual center of the galaxy ends up shifted though, so the excessive red shift isn't so excessive; while that would also keep the blue shifted side flat.  (Blue shifted emitters would have the effective angle we see more from the top side vs their forward velocity vector which is less blue-shifted).  
I don't find any reference in calculating galactic rotation curves that mentions their aberration; but that goes back to the first/second sentence that I don't see mentions of light aberration applying on the transmission side anyway.
