# Math of Spherical Surface Displacement

This ends up considering that gravity is a increasing gradient towards the source; the strength of gravity is stronger; rather than the convention that the kinetic energy component is large far away.  The relation between these is f(x)=1/x.

Lines are straight lines to light.

## Demo

I started testing the compression idea using geogebra.

- [Geogebra 3D graph](https://www.geogebra.org/3d/mb5wpnu6) - I started testing the math here, but subtracting |x| and |y| independently from the hyperbolic displacements make more of a bell curve instead of an arc; especially very close to 0.

Some toys test displacing straight lines by an extrinsic curvature.

- [Single Source](https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/math/mathSphereDecay) - This shows curvature for a single point displacement.
- [4 Sources](https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/math/gravityFields.html) - This is 4 point displacements; the points  do not move and do not scale with the displacement they generate.
- [3D 4 sources](https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/index-gravity-field.html) - 3D stack of multiple planes; with the 'zLevel' set near 0, the planes of 'geodesic light paths' include the plane of the displacements.
- [Inner Rotation Curve Explorer](https://d3x0r.github.io/STFRPhysics/3d/indexSphereMap3.html) - This explores what the frames are for the proposed filler curve; turns out to be geodesic rotations of a frame from one pole through the other and back to the start with the originating orientation.

The `Displacment A` slider controls the inner displacement of 0.  The point that used to be at 0 is no longer at 0, but is instead
shoved away from the 0 by some amount.  Straight lines are proportionally scaled such that there position relative to the 0 is still the same.... as the radius increases, the surface area of the spheres increase more than the radius, 
which allows a larger radius to contain any inner radius plus some amount of its original amount, which results in a net decay of displacement over distance from the source. 

The graph shows the (red) circular displacement, where 0,1,2,3,4,... units are displaced from their original position.  The innermost circle is 0, and there is no space within the 0; this is entirely where curvature and rotations. 

Then X lines are in green, and Y lines are drawn in the intial position with no displacement curvature; then as `Displacment A` is increased, the lines around 0 deviate.  The lines crossing near 0 are not At 0, so they will bend around; 
This would be a good place to put a Schrodinger operator, where the path to the left or right is uncertain, and either is viable; (usually these result as a collision, imparting a linear momentum).

The inner lines (< 0 in the circles) are the difference each point is displaced from it's origin; it's the delta of the x/y lines... green and blue match respecitvely (the green is the (x,y,z) change in the Y=n geodesic lines.  blue is the (x,y,z) change in the X=n geodesic lines).

The `Offset Z` is offset of the Z position being viewed, if X and Y are the gridlines; it's a distance away from the center; it was meant more as a bias on the Y direction that moving up, there's less and less displacment (scanning the graph from left to right 
the green lines up 'up' less and less the further away they are, this offset controls how far every point is away from the origin.

When `Displacment A` is ____ then `Offset Z`
 - less than - ( the space geodesics are closed, and fill follow space like paths )
 - greater than or equal to - almost no apparent curvature is overserved, but you do start to see the spinning core; this is a close graph of geodeics.

`Displacment B` dialates the inner infinity and inserts another graph.  This is the derivitive of the curve actually.

Displacment A and Displacement B I think are spaces that rotate between themselves, representing an electro static and electromagnetic field.

(Perhaps there's a Displacment C for Strong force?  I suspect Weak Force will fall out as time-base probability of change.)

### A thing that's spinning continue's to spin....

The only way that rotation could have itself inertia is if it was never an angular velocity at some distance, but was instead a spin in place.  The inner geodesics follow rotation-like paths.

Minkowski space and most systems only consider conservation of energy (barly) in order to allow rotation; but there's many places where the loss to velocity would be notable; spin really does deserve its own thing.

(should go back and edit first prinicples and fill in some of this displacement stuff.)

(Multiple sources will sum together, having a source smaller than a significant amount of curvature)

## Analogy of Math to reality

We start with a circle of radius 0.

The hyperbolic curve minus X is the path around the displacement.

`Q_0` This is length in light-space.

`Q_1` is the inverse translation from 'real' to (x/y/z) in light space.

`dQ_0` is the first derivitive of Q_0.  This curve isn't shown... they are lines that bow outward/form a circle around the origin.

`A_0` This converts any arbitrary value from flat space to light space

The code later uses A_0(x, (x,y,z,Q) -> (x,y,z) ) - x  which removes the sloped part of hte hyparbolic, which is the deviation from a straight line (or a light-like path).

``` js
const _2to1 = (x,y)=> Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y);
const _3to1 = (x,y,z)=> Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z);
const _4to1 = (x,y,z,w)=> Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z+w*w);

const Q_0 = _4to1;  // length in displaced space
const Q_i = (x,y,z,Q) => Math.sqrt( x*x+y*y+z*z-Q*Q );  // from converted to real (unsquash)
const dQ_0 = (l,x,y,z,Q) => l/_4to1(x,y,z,Q);  // from real to converted (squash)
const A_0 = (l,x,y,z,Q) => l/Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y+z*z) * Q_0(x,y,z,Q)
```

##  Parallel Transport rotations

This resulted in a quation that's a plane in 3d rotation space...


# Slopes and gradients

the displacement isn't enough to worry about, the different in displacements is what IS important

depending on the direction it was a radial offset (only it's a sum of different radial inputs )

// 1/x = d log(x)  
// 1+1/x  
// x / (itself plus inner size sum)
// 
// there's a curl in the flat surface with just 4 emitters.
// if there's boundary conditions to prevent this, I expect it wouldn't be such an issue.



## Working notes

   Along the way I picked up some clues from these guys and others not mentioned...

``` txt

   ------------------
   
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBJCCe81OCg
   pseudo reimanian spacetime
   
   squared lengths have +,0,-   (+ length is timelike, -length is space like and 0 is light-like)
   
   and we have a relation of theta between space and time where 0 degrees is lightlike and >0 +pi/4 is timelike and <0 -pi/4 is spacelike
      - lightlike is proper time is 0 (but that makes proper space 0 too?)
   
   1x3 
   
   spaces with metrics 'apply metric' is to transform from a conventional 'flat' notation to their real coordinates, and get a resulting length; but then the lines are continuous transformations that get a different length
   between the chord length and the arc length; which are both different from the intrinsic length.
     chord lengths leave the manifold... so it's arc length
   
   tangent velocity vector ( working form 2d, on a sphere)
   
   ----
   parallel transport.  
   
   So I have this vector - it's in some directionon the manifold; but it's in some direction tangent to the manifold, and to compare that vector with another
   I have- the transform in the manifold space has to be found.
   
   geodesic - parallel transport of vector along its own direction is parallel to itself.
   
   --------------------
   Primary perpendiculars https://www.geogebra.org/3d/ehvemap2
   given V1, V2, cross product is also....
   https://www.geogebra.org/3d/vmhcjr4h
   
   https://www.geogebra.org/3d/vmhcjr4h so; in a sense, 
   cross product is... every vector has a perpendicular that is a projection in the frame's plane... 
   (V1 dot planes, and then swap coordinates for perpendicular) dot ( v2 dot planes ); 
	each plane give the coodinate for the axis perpendiular to that plane... (so the final dot projection is actually an off-plane result)
   
   (V2 dot planes(yz,xz,xy) ) -> (0,b,c)   (A)
                                 (a,0,c)
                                 (a,b,0)
					 
   (V1 primary perpendiculars) -> (0,c,-b)    (B)
                                  (-c,0,a)
								  (b,-a,0)
								  
    cross = A dot B

// so my output is 6 coordinates.
// which means my vectorsare really 6 oordinates... and not 4.

				t5	 (a,0,c,0,0,0)					 
				t6	 (a,b,0,0,0,0)
					 
					 
      v2 into spaces? 
						(0,y,z,w)
						(x,0,z,w)
						(x,y,0,w)
						(x,y,z,0)
						
						
		// err, perpendiculars are spaces..... 
   (V1 primary (space)perpendiculars) -> (0,c,d,-b)    (B)
                                         (d,0,a,-c)
						       		     (b,-d,0,a)
								         (c,-a,b,0)

   (V1 primary perpendiculars) -> (d,0,0,-a)    (B)
                                  (0,d,0,-b)
								  (0,0,d,-c)
								  (c,0,-a,0)
								  (b,-a,0,0)


- so the perpendicular of a projection of a vector onto a plane is also parpendicular to that vector. ?

	(there are many pperpendiculars to choose from - but like the above, a specific pairing represents a right-left handed system
	
	angle-angle-angle-angle -> rotate around x,y,z,w simultaneously.
	
	1) rotating around X with W?
	   - y->z gets lost.
	     - should be an implicit change of y->w and z->w ; an x axis rotation IS perpendicular ot these.
         with z->y and y->z		 
	   
	   
	   ----
	   So in 3D the axis perpendiular to the plane is also a real axis...  'xy'=z, 
	   
	   in 4D, the axis is more properly the 'xy', or 'yz' axis, and you never actually rotate around a 'w' axis.
	     but now saying 'around the z axis' is not enough, you'd have to specify more specifically xy, xw, or yw axis to rotate around.
		 
		 ----------------------
		 SO back converting form 6 coordinates to 4 coordinates...
		 
		 yz yw zw  - x axis rotation should affect these....
		 xz xw zw  - y
		 xy xw yw  - z
		 xy xz yz  - w
		 
		xy xz xw  
		xy yz yw
		xz yz zw
		xw yw zw  any change in value in any of these planes would affect the W component in the other plane, and change that value...
		
		// these planes are mutually orthagonal.
		// a rotation in one of these planes can leave its paired plane unchanged.
		// 
		yz = xw
		xz = yw
		xy = zw
		
		// rotating these planes modifies all of the other planes.
		yz = xy xz yw zw
		xz = xy yz xw zw
		xy = xz yz xw yw
		xw = xy xz yw zw
		yw = xy yz xw zw
		zw = xz yz xw yw
		
		
		x wx
		y wy
		z yz
		
		
		xx = square linear metric.
		xxx = cube linear metric?
		
		4d Rotation is extra complex - 2 planes are invariant
		like the 1 axis is invariant

	  so... to show geodesics...
	  motion on a sphere is 2?1?d, 1 forward 1 angle.

	  the initial angle doesn't matter except to bias the whole graph.
	  
	  (0, k * arclength )  for some forward distance of arclength, on a curvature of k ( with radius radius of 1/k )
	 
		( (?,?,?), k*arclength ) is the axis-angle representation, where ?,?,? is the normal of the geodesic.
		    for any position on the sphere, only certain directions are allowed to be geodesic, and they lie in a plane with the position as the normal
		
		    from the origin, this plane is the x/z plane
		
		up() = 'up'. the plane perpendicular to this contains the rotation axis.
		    (set the normal x/z rotation, and then rotate to this?)
			the rotation vector for this up should be a real coordinate, with real bias, eventhoug there's a 2x rotation.
