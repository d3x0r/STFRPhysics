# Appendix E (Exam Question)

Having developed the math, even though it was different from the Lorentz
Transformation, I figured it would be good to test in answering some
questions on a forum; unfortunately, I found that although the answers
were correct, they were incorrect if the Lorentz Transform was required
to be applied. Here’s the question.

"While you're having breakfast in the morning, a creature in the
Andromeda galaxy is doing the same. We call the two breakfast events
event X (on Earth) and event Y (in the Andromeda galaxy).
"Simultaneously" means simultaneous in your reference frame. If instead
we describe the two events in another reference frame, that of a space
traveler who is traveling at a very high speed from the Andromeda galaxy
towards Earth, which of the following statements is correct?

\- A. Event X and event Y are simultaneous.

\- B. Event X occurs before event Y.

\- C. Event Y occurs before event X.

\- D. The question is not well-defined, as we cannot define simultaneity
for events that do not occur at the same place in space.

I get that it has something to do with that the traveler is going at
relativistic speeds which means things will move slower relative to him.
I just don't get how the gamma factor ties in to the problem context"

To get a single answer, I had to interpret that the breakfast was
simultaneous \*to 'you' while eating breakfast\* (that you were watching
them eat breakfast on a monitor while you are also eating), which makes
the answer ‘C’. (The ‘correct’ answer is ‘B’) Otherwise there are
multiple choices. And even made an image.

Figure E-1 : On the left, would be based on the reasoning applied to get
a single answer. On the right, however, at some real time A(ndromeda)
and E(arth) have breakfast, and the light cones of those events are
drawn in black; probably the thickness of the line is the entire
duration of that event. Depending on when the ship passes Andromeda at
some high speed, they could see (1) earth first, and then never
Andromeda, if they passed Andromeda after breakfast was eaten. (2) that
they see andromeda first and then earth. Or (3) that they could see
earth first and then andromeda. Another line between 2 and 3 could be
drawn that would intersect in the middle when the light cones intersect,
and they could say they were simultaneous. The 4<sup>th</sup> line off
the bottom would also show Earth first and Andromeda some long time
later; but they would be past earth when they saw the earth event catch
up to them. This doesn’t even really care about the relatively variable
speed of light for the observing ship; it’s just a flat world line
graph.

I would think light cones in figure E-1 would be pretty much the
constant speed of light every frame can agree with. It’s also not a
matter of poor phrasing of the question, but rather is an inherent flaw
in Lorentz Transform that students will just have to ‘shut up and
calculate’ since there’s no other means to reason the solution.

This link has a section about halfway down that is basically the same
scenario, and uses the Lorentz Transform in the same way that would get
‘B’ as an answer. I didn’t record the math of another person who helped
the questioner, since it was the same sort of terms as this.

In these scenarios the observer that is ‘between’ Andromeda and Earth or
in the train is chained to the center of the train and is unable to
move. An observer that is ‘near the train’ is really under the train, or
the train is passing through them. Given those constraints, then since
the ship is moving from andromeda to earth, they must see the earth
event first and then andromeda. There is no freedom to intersect
anywhere in-between, but rather they must start from the center between
Andromeda and Earth.
