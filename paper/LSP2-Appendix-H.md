# Appendix H (Paradoxes)

Since the inception of Special Relativity, people have challenged the
idea with many wonderful thought experiments.

## A Rotating Body

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrenfest_paradox>

The radius does not contract, and light aberration happens, so an
observer in the middle of the wheel spinning with it observes no
particular change.

The specific moments at tangents to the wheel do contract, which
increases the space between the atoms, lowering their coupling forces,
and results in the wheel flying apart far before it gets to a huge
fraction of the speed of light. The lowered cohesion is overwhelmed by
centrifugal forces.

But assuming an ideal virtual spinning body, the local area of the disk
is always the same for an observer at any point on the disk. If the disk
is viewed from an external source, then distortions to the disk may be
observed. The opposing side of a disk viewed from a point on the disk
will travel potentially at 2c if the edge you’re on is rotating at c.

## A Neutral Buoyant Body

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplee%27s_paradox>

A contracted body which previously displaced an amount of water to
maintain its depth no longer displaces as much water around it, and
appears heavier, sinking.

## Two Ships Attached with a Thread

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_spaceship_paradox>

As the ships contract, and the thread contracts, it will eventually
break in many places at once at a sufficiently high velocity.

Saving property – the thread’s contraction can drag on the forward ship
causing it to not accelerate as much, since the force it applies get
amplified; if the ships were already going at a very fast rate, the
thread’s drag would be enough to stop them from contracting away; but at
a low speed, the thread would undoubtedly break.

## Ladder Passing Through a Barn

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_paradox>

This one is interesting. It depends on the observer’s position in the
situation. This is assuming also that the contracted length of the
ladder makes it still be longer than the barn; but even a ladder that
does fit in the barn, can be seen as extending past the barn, based on
the observation of the doors, or fitting entirely within the barn.

-   An observer in the barn, centered between the doors, only one door    is open at a time.
-   An observer outside the barn, centered between the doors will see    both doors open at some point, and the ladder didn’t fit.
-   An observer biased towards the first door that opens sees both doors    closed at a time, and the ladder fit in the barn.
-   An observer biased towards the second door sees both doors open, and    the ladder did not fit in the barn.
