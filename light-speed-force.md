a marble 1(M) unit of mass is hit with a force that moves 1(M) mass 1(S) distance per 1(NS) tick

F=mA

A=1/1
F=1

in a frame moving at V in C, the distance is contracted sqrt(1-VV/CC) so light travels sqrt(1-VV/CC) in C-V

in contracted time, the forward is a linear line from 1 second to 2 seconds; as your speed increases, 
light takes longer to go forward than backward, and light is not the speed of light always (AFAICT 
not even in SR/lorentz transform).  

but really we're here to figure out the force difference, or the resulting velocity difference from the above
force on thing moving far from the speed of light...

1) forward, on the contracted local clock, the marble will take 2 seconds to go forward, and will take 0 time to go backward.
2) the marble's resulting velocity must be S/2 forward and S/Infinity backward
3) But some sort of relativistic velocity addition forumula needs to happen (probably the same as Einstein's, but lets do it the long way first)

V'=V+At

fromReal(V 0 to C ->0 to inf) Vl = VC/sqrt(CC-V^2)         sign(V)*C/sqrt((CC/VV)-1)    $\frac{\operatorname{sign}\left(x\right)C}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{CC}{xx}-1\right)}}$

fromFeels(V 0 to inf ->0 to C)   V = VlC/sqrt(CC+Vl^2)       sign(Vl)*C/sqrt((CC/Vl^2)+1)  $\frac{\operatorname{sign}\left(x\right)C}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{CC}{xx}+1\right)}}$

Time contraction from Feels =  C/sqrt(CC+VV)   $\frac{C}{\sqrt{\left(CC+xx\right)}}$

Time Contraction = 0.5 at sqrt(3)*C   $\sqrt{3}C$

or for any M contraction =   $C\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{MM}-1\right)}$
TC0.1 =  9.95  sqrt(99)C
TC=0.9 =  100-81/81  sqrt(19/81)  0.2345679012345679...

more like 3599/3600 or drop 1 second in 1 hour 0 = .0005558

$\frac {3600*3600-3599*3599}{3599*3599}$

$(N^2-(N-1)^2)/(N-1)^2$

(2N-1)/ (NN - (2N-1))

```
A=2*N+1
B=N*N
A/(B-A)
```


real from local added  (Vl+V2)C/sqrt(CC+(V1+V2)^2 )

local from real added  (Vl+V2)C/sqrt(CC+(V1+V2)^2 )



Vl    C/sqrt(CC+Vl^2))/sqrt( CC/(CC+Vl^2))


Still haven't addressed the force issue... so we know how much time is dilated at the time, so every calculation we have should have that applied to match local clock(?)

at 0.5 time dilation, takes takes 1.5 to reach the front and 0.5 to reach the back.   (?)
at 0.25 time dilation, it takes 1.25 to reach the front and 0.75 to reach the back

D/V=1.5  (1+td)  (1-td)
D/V=1.25  (1+td) (1-td)

 ${\Gamma} D={x}\vec{V} ( ({1+\Gamma}) T )$

${\Gamma} D={x}\vec{V} ( ({1-\Gamma}) T )$

I do know how long light takes at various speeds, and how much that differs from C....

This is just a true statement... not really sure what 'solve' there is for this.  The contracted length spanned by light going C-V takes 1+V/C seconds to cross in the forward direction on the contracted clock.

$\frac{\Gamma C_L}{C-V/C} = 1+V/C$

$\frac{\frac{C}{\sqrt{CC-VV}} C_L}{C-V/C} = 1+V/C$

$\frac{CC}{\sqrt{CC-VV}(1-V)} C_L = 1+V/C$

$\frac{CCC}{\sqrt{CC-VV}(1-V)} C_L = C+V$

$\frac{CCC}{\sqrt{CC-VV}} C_L = C-VC+V-VV$

$\frac{CCC}{\sqrt{CC-VV}} C_L = (C+1)-V(C+1)-VV$


$\frac{CCC}{\sqrt{CC-VV}} C_L = (\sqrt{(C+1)}+V)^2 -(C+1)^2 + (C+1)$

Similarly to the above, this is also true, the contracted length spanned b light going C+V takes 1-V/C time units to get there.
$\frac{\Gamma C_L}{C+V/C} = 1-V/C$

And more generally, for light going some arbitrary direction; sin theta is angle from left or right towards front is positive and towards back is negative....

$\frac{\Gamma C_L}{C- sin(\theta)V/C} = 1+sin(\theta)V/C$

sin theta is assuming the frame is moving in a direction, and $\vec{V}$ is the vector of the ball being launched within that frame.

${\Gamma} D={x} \vec{V} ( (1+sin{\theta}{\Gamma}) T )$

x is the variable to find... solve the above for x (?)

$\frac{{\Gamma} D}{ \vec{V} ( (1+sin{\theta}{\Gamma}) T )}={x}$

in this case, V = D/T  ... D = VT in the basic case...  so D/T and 1/V should result in a direction vector (D is a vector in this case though?)

at this point , this looks entirely like directional time dilation, but the fact is this is still 1 time tick, the resulting velocity changes so it doesn't go as far in that time.... so the acceleration is modified.
$D=\frac { \vec{V} } { (1+\frac{C}{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}} \frac{\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V_F}}{|\vec{V}|\ |{\vec{V_F}|}})} T$  

$D = V*X*1$

1 + (1 to 0) (direction sin(\theta))  where theta is the angle from forward.  at backward, this is effectively a -1 for the time scalar, and forward is +1.  there is 0 change in velocity laterally.

so an acceleration results in a velocity...

V' = V+At

$\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{C}{\sqrt{\left(CC-xx\right)}}x\right)}$

$\frac{1}{1-\left(\frac{C}{\sqrt{\left(CC-xx\right)}}x\right)}$


$\vec{x} = (\vec{x}-\vec{x} * \frac{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}}{|\vec{x}|\ |\vec{y}|}) + \vec{x} * \frac{\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}}{|\vec{x}|\ |\vec{y}|}$

$\vec{x} = (\vec{x}-\vec{x} * sin(\theta)) + \vec{x} * sin(\theta)$

$\vec{x}(b) = (\vec{x}-\vec{x} * sin(\theta)) + b*\vec{x} * sin(\theta)$

$V' = \frac{1}{ \left( (1+(\frac{C}{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}} \frac{\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V_F}}{ |{\vec{V_F}|}}) ) \right)}A$


seems that it's probably just `time dilation * force` 



$\frac{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}} |\vec{V}|\ |{\vec{V_F}|}}+C*\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V_F}}{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}} |\vec{V}|\ |{\vec{V_F}|}}$

T=0...
$V = A \frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}} |\vec{V}|\ |{\vec{V_F}|}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}} |\vec{V}|\ |{\vec{V_F}|}}+C*\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V_F}}$


$1+(\frac{C}{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}} \sin{\theta})$

$\frac{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C \sin{\theta}}{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}$

$\frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C \sin{\theta}}$

$V=A\frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C}$

$V=A-A(\sin(\theta))+((A*\sin(\theta)\frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C \sin{\theta}})$

this is including length contraction for the distance needed to go in a certain time; and what the velocity must be to cover said distance in the required time.

$V(V,A,T,\theta)=V+(A-A(\sin(\theta))+((A*\sin(\theta)\frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C \sin{\theta}}))T$
$V(V,A,T)=V+((A\frac{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}{{\sqrt{CC-\vec{V}\cdot\vec{V}}}+ C \sin{\theta}}))T$

(backward velocity)
