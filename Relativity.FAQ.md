# Null experiments

frequency and wavelength aren't changed by speed.  They are changed by having the space light goes through change (LIGO), such as gravitational waves.  

### Outstanding point
Time dilates at speed.
Time dilated in gravity.

Standing on the ground, it's like you're already at the speed of your weight against the ground.  your weight isn't increasing with time.  your momentum is at a balance of other changes to your velocity.  If you stand still on ice or quicksand it breaks less... you're not continually being shoved into the ground.  A hydraulic press might be an acceleration force that doesn't just stop when it meets something.  

Rockets accelerate things - in a  box you feel it laterally - consider a box in a gravity well, that's at rest moving latterally in the field.  (I dunno, sounds like a train to me?)  A rocket would keep your box in space in free-fall against the ground.   But a rocket isnt' the same as a box at velocity in gravity.  A that would sort of be a box within the box that's itself free falling, and eventually the outer box will slam into it with a greater force.    But it's sort of a difference of who has the energy increase?  Doesn't matter right?  equal and opposite but still sort of the same?

in gravity in freefall, the box gets more speed - and you can look outside the box and see you're moving fast; I'm admitting all availble sources of information that might tell you about your state... because we're smart, and we know that moving at the speed of light causes our clocks to go slow, and we can compensate.  There is increased aberration at speed (significant enough speed to really care).

We're moving at 0.12%c relative to the cmb.  Our fastest space craft is parker space probe - at 0.04% the speed of light.  So the best it does is 0.08% to 0.16%.  almost 2 parts in a thousand... but at that end of the scale that's insignficant, at 10% the speed of light 

# The Reality of Relativity

So - box, in freefall, in gravity, and a box, at velocity, away from gravity.

One model is a box with a way to accelerate, with a box in it that is in freefall.  When the outer box accelerates, the kinetic energy of that box increases.

A box in gravity itself gains kinetic/potential energy, and none of the participants notice.  The gravity source accelerating you isn't gaining energy as the above box model would imply.

A box at velocity, internally, has nothing to keep contents towards any particular side, unless that box accelerates.  Then, relativisitcally, increasing speed, you already have a lot of energy in your momentum, and adding additional energy is more difficult, so the strain on your feed standing on a surface that is accelerating would be more; but the ability to accelerate has been diminished, so in the end, you feel like you're still accelerating.

## Clock assumption  1

The 4 way speed of light is un-managably long given V and C to get (what is it to be gotten? the inverse function for gamma from V )

Light always passes an observer at at-least the speed of light.  When aligned along the velocity, a photon will travel past you at the speed of light (C) according to your clock (T) and your speed (V).  The actual speed it passes you is (C-V).  so your clock scalar must be  C/(C-V).  Or the reverse function $\frac{C\left(\left|V\right|\right)}{\left(\left|V\right|+C\right)}$ (maybe).  This is simple.  

## 1 way speed test(modern)

"Test of the Constancy of the Velocity of Electromagnetic Radiation in High Vacuum"  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/69D/jresv69Dn4p623_A1b.pdf

This is an interferometer - it's comparing wavlengths, not wave speeds.   Along the electromagnetic spectrum, they all have different wavelengths and frequencies, but the same wavespeed... how fast the wave go there doesn't change that it's that frequency of wave.  

LIGO tests changes of frequency of waves in the same way - over 'long' distances, because it's reflected many times before being recombined.  Speed doesn't change anything about the wave in ligo - it doesn't suffer some sort of drift in frequency as it moves around - as shown by pretty much every null experiment before. 

## Better test for length contraction


https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/experiments.html#Length_Contraction

At this time there are no direct tests of length contraction, as measuring the length of a moving object to the precision required has not been feasible.  There is, however, a demonstration that it occurs:

A current-carrying wire is observed to be electrically neutral in its rest frame, and a nearby charged particle at rest in that frame is unaffected by the current.  A nearby charged particle that is moving parallel to the wire, however, is subject to a magnetic force that is related to its speed relative to the wire.  If one considers the situation in the rest frame of a charge moving with the drift velocity of the electrons in the wire, the force is purely electrostatic due to the different length contractions of the positive and negative charges in the wire (the former are fixed relative to the wire, while the latter are mobile with drift velocities of a few mm per second).  This approach gives the correct quantitative value of the magnetic force in the wire frame.  This is discussed in more detail in: Purcel, Electricity and Magnetism.  It is rather remarkable that relativistic effects for such a tiny speed explain the enormous magnetic forces we observe.

# wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction#Magnetic_forces

"In 1820, [André-Marie Ampère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9-Marie_Amp%C3%A8re "André-Marie Ampère") showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another."  It then goes on to apply the idea of length contraction to the problem.


## hypothetical experiment

How about a couple electron beams in a vacuum, which also experience a magnetic attractive force because they don't deviate from just being electrons and no protons.  There's nothing to play the part of the attractive force.    

- One way is 'the length is contracted', in which case if you put the beams through a Stern-Gerlach device there would be a random orientation of spins, and should be 50-50% output.

- One way is 'there's a magnetic field already there' and the field will also align the nearby compass needles in a direction; where a pure electrostatic approach would have no preferred alignment.

show me an experiment that's two electron beams, with their spin outcomes measured?  - Maybe two conductors, but I'm not sure you can measure the polarity of electrons directly from a wire.

It's not electrostatic forces that polarize light in a  certain direction; because there's no perferred orientation from electrostatics.

(another source, not as good) http://www.rexresearch.com/leedskal/leedskal.htm  Edward leedskalnin noticed an attraction and a repulsion - if you reverse the current, then the magnetic fields oppose and push the wires apart.  It's partially to resist this change in motion that another current might be induced in another nearby conductor that doesn't already have a potential driving it.

### Electrostatic vs Electrodynamic
It's been a good paradigm to say 'a moving charge generates a magnetic field'.  But that is indistinguishable from 'a charge that moves is a magnetic field'.  
An electron that's stationary, has a position and a field. An electron that's moving has a velocity and a field; although the field when it's moving is magnetic and is aligned along the velocity of the motion.  Once that magnetic field collapses back into an electron somewhere, the it goes back to being a position, and asserting itself as an attraction and repulsion depending on whether it's against a different or same other charge in the area.  When an electron is in a place, it has a momentum relative to its local  rest frame, not relative to the photon frame.  
An electron as a magnetic field has an uncertain position, and a electron in a place has an uncertain velocity; until induced in a direction.  

Electrons passing through a homogenous magnetic field experience a change in velocity direction; this is considered to be an acceleration.  This is a torque on the magnetic field that's aligned in the direction of the velocity, that causes a precession of the magnetic field, which then when it's collapsing, it induces other collapsed electrons into motion in the new direction.

The current through an inductor is the same until the magnetic field of the inductor is 0, and no further current can be induced.

- See also Eric Dollard's Lone Pine Writings - these are somewhat incomplete but cover a lot of the basics of the electro static(capacitors ) and electromagnetic (inductors), and the flow of energy between the two - while in a conductor the electrons are both electrostatic and electromagnetic with a high rate of change between states- electrons in a capacitor have a position, and electrons in an inductor have a momentum/inertia, which continues to push current forward until it's depleted.   


A approaching north pole and a receeding south pole look the same, as with a approaching south pole and receeding north pole.   

A approaching north pole induces a current in other inductors (if available) that generates a field opposite to itself; and the current it generates when collapsing is in the opposite direction from the original current.  But then that increased current generates a rising magnetic field, such that if there's a lag in the other conductor, it will help carry that current forward in the other direction.  If the field doesn't collapse anywhere else, it will collapse back into the wire itself... although it doesn't have to ever collapse (?) Permanent magnets - the electrons that are the field never really collapse back into motion (otherwise you might have induction in a wire just near a magnet as the fields constantlly form and collapse)... or in a PMH (Leedskalnin) - basically a U core wound with some turns of wire, and a bar - but really two halves of a block with a single conductor running through it will cause a magnetic lock.
